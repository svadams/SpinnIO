# SpinnIO
Spinnaker IO library

About the SpinnIO library
-------------------------

This is a (hopefully) easy to use
way to access functionality for spike injection and collection
to/from a SpiNNaker board

See the example program for a basic idea of how to use
the library from a C++ program

To build the SpinnIO library
----------------------------

1. cd to build directory

2. do ccmake ../

3. do sudo make install to install to /usr/local/lib

4. manually copy the include files from library_src/include 
   to /usr/local/include
